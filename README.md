# WATCH FROM SHORE

## An app to enable efficient Whale Watching from shore

Trusted users can log in, and when they see a whale, the app will centre a map on their location, and they can touch where the whale(s) are and drag toward the direction they are moving in.

After a confirmation, this will trigger an alert that will notify others in the network with a link to the sightting location.
